RollItUp
========

RollItUp is a single player implementation of one of my gaming concepts. In this game, player is supposed to avoid obstacles(bricks) that spawn in certain pattern, as the ball scrolls thorough the screen from left to right. 
Every time player manages to survive, he/she earns 10 points. I intend to make this game a multiplayer game(details shall be shared, if asked). 
The Game Engine I've used is Cocos2dx 3.2(c++ implementation). I'm uploading 'Classes' directory and 'Resources' directory.
If you already have standard directory structure, set up, you can directly use these files to run this project. 
Any comments/ tips / advices are welcome.
Cheers !
